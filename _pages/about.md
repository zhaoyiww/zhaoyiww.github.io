I am a PhD student in the [Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy (GSEG)](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/people-group.html) group at the [Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (IGP)](https://igp.ethz.ch/) of [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I am advised by [Prof. Andreas Wieser](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/group-head/prof-dr--andreas-wieser.html) and [Prof. Konrad Schindler](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/group/people/person-detail.schindler.html).

My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and remote sensing for monitoring applications, with a focus on image-assisted point cloud processing, including point cloud registration (rigid case) and landslide monitoring (deformable case).

<span style="color: red;">I expect to graduate in December 2025. I am looking for a postdoctoral position.</span>
