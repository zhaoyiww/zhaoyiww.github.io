## What is 3D Gaussian Splatting?

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a differentiable rasterization technique for novel scene representation. It is characterized by:

- Describing a scene using a collection of anisotropic Gaussians
- Rendering via splatting these Gaussians onto a screen
- Bridging the gap between point-based graphics and neural rendering

For an accessible introduction, see [Hugging Face Blog: Introduction to 3D GS](https://huggingface.co/blog/gaussian-splatting).

## Limitations

- Although the rendering quality is visually compelling, the accuracy does not meet the precision standards required for geodetic deformation monitoring.
- Current methods are trained on 2D images, which may degrade 3D surface fidelity, especially in sparse or occluded regions.
